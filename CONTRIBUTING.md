## Local Development

As we need Vercel for development, kindly [create an account](https://vercel.com/signup) if you do not have one.

1.  Fork the repository and clone the code to your local machine.
2.  Run `npm install` in the repository root.
3.  Run the command `vercel dev` to start a development server at <https://localhost:3000>.
4.  The cards will then be available from this local endpoint (i.e. `https://localhost:3000/api`).

Optional - To work with API Ninjas

5.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the directory.
6.  In the .env file add a new variable named `API_NINJAS_KEY` with your [API Ninjas Key](https://api-ninjas.com/profile) ([create an account](https://api-ninjas.com/register) if you do not have one).

## Themes Contribution

GitHub Readme Daily Quotes supports [custom theming](./README.md#customization). However, if you love a theme that is missing, or you want to contribute new themes, please kindly add the theme! üòä

All you need to do is edit the [themes/index.ts](./src/app/themes/index.ts) file and add your theme at the end of the file.

While creating the Pull Request to add a new theme, **don't forget to add the svg of the card**.
